# Whatsapp Chat Analyzer

Have you ever wondered who is the nastiest in the group chat? Which member posts the most? Who takes the longest to reply?

I created this project for learning by doing. Its sole purpose is to write your own parser and to learn the basics of data mining and data analytics. 
I went through several experiments for optimazations, performance increase and parsing issues (god damn you invisible characters!)
Besides, interesting statistics, visualizations and insights can be gained from the analyzed chat messages.
